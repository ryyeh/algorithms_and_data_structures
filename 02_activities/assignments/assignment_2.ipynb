    "Assignment 1 for me requires design and implementation of question 2 which is to return all root to leaf paths in a binary tree. The first step was to think about how to do it methodically. The most simple way is to walk from the root to each leaf node and writing down each path as we do it. For example, using the first example given, we will find the path between 1-->3, and then 1-->5, 1-->6, and finally 1-->7. Next step was to translate that into detail step-by-step in terms of using a treenode data structure. And finally code it and test it. Finally we go thru the code and determine the time and space complexity and check if there are any optimization that can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, the approach I've taken is first determine what a solution would most likely look like, and then compare it to my partner's design and implementation. In order to find the duplicate closest to the root, it is necessary to know all the duplicate values first before determining which is the closest. That means either to walk the tree twice (once to get all the values in the tree, and second time to find the closest to the root), or alternatively to do one walk but needs to remember all the values and their distance from the root. After determining what a solution should look like, first look at my partner's code quickly revealed one major issue with the design which is returning the first found duplicate. However looking past the major issue with the code, the rest of the coding does appear to be correct and reflect the design as shown by the comment."
